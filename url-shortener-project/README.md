# Project Title
URL-Shortner
For an onboarding project we were tasked with creating a URL-Shortener similar to bit.ly or tinyurl.com

## About the Project

The project was to create a simple URL-Shortener as onboarding to our company. 
We added a blocklist feature which would check each URL for certain keywords which were held in a list and if the URL contained any of the keywords, a shortened URL would not be created. 
The technologies used are PostGres, SpringBoot and Java.
